# OpenCore 8.2 EFI for Asus Prime H310M-E-R2.0-BR / i5-9600K Intel UHD Graphics 630 (iGPU)
<p>Updated version of my previous OpenCore EFI (7.9)</p>

1. Timeout is set to '5'
2. ShowPicker is set to 'true'
3. Verbose mode is enabled '-v'
4. HideAuxiliary is set to 'false'

<p>If you want to use the Ventura Beta you'll have to update to the OpenCore 8.3 and all it's main kexts (Lilu, Whatevergreen, VirtualSMC and AppleALC).</p>
